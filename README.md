# ImageGallery

Create a gallery of images using Django.
- Each image can have tags(can be multiple tags) (eg. -
Sketch,Nature,Portrait,Cars,Wildlife…)
- Paginate the pages (max 8 images per page)
- We can filter the images in the gallery by their tags (single or multiple). Selecting a
tag or some tags will show only the images with those tags in the gallery.
- Clicking an image in gallery will take us to a page for that specific image. Add two
buttons there to rotate the image 90 degree clockwise or anti-clockwise.(Image
should be rotated and the resulting image should be saved in the media folder
replacing the previous(actual) image)
- Add an input form to upload new images -
• Select tags : multi-select input
• Select Images : multiple image input
• Upload Button
